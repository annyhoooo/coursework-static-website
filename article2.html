            I chose Turing because of an impressive movie I watched in
            college called "The Imitation Game". The genius Turing in the film
            has a quirky yet candid, captivating, and complex personality.
            However, he possesses an extraordinary aptitude for mathematics and
            computing, which allowed him to successfully decrypt one of the most
            challenging codes in history - the Enigma machine. In fact, I heard
            of Turing's name in elementary and middle school. Computer textbooks
            at the time described him as the "Father of Computer Science". Upon
            revisiting Turing's story as an adult, I realised his contributions
            to the computer field were pioneering.

              Alan Turing was born in London on June 23, 1912, and from an early
              age demonstrated remarkable logical thinking and mathematical
              abilities. In 1936, at the age of 24, he published the renowned
              paper "On computable numbers, with an application to the
              Entscheidungsproblem". In this paper, he introduced the concept of
              "Computing machines", not an actual machine but an abstract
              computational model, though immensely powerful and capable of
              simulating intricate algorithms. Its design is simple, comprising an
              infinitely long tape and a read-write probe. Its operational logic
              corresponds to the read-write, state judgment, and jumping of a
              computer program(Turing 1936). It remains a core concept in
              theoretical computer science and provides the theoretical foundation
              for modern computers. This concept is also called the "Turing
              machine".

              During World War II, Turing joined the
              team tasked with deciphering German telegrams. The Germans used an
              encryption device called the Enigma machine, which encrypted
              plaintext in thousands of possible ways, resulting in billions of
              password combinations(Kahn 1996). Turing and other cryptographers
              made significant efforts to crack this code. They searched for
              vulnerabilities in the vast volume of telegrams, such as the fact
              that morning messages would always contain information about the
              weather, or that telegrams would mention "explosion" after
              intentional detonations. They used these clues to deduce the
              encryption key. Moreover, Turing designed a machine to speed up key
              calculations, known as the "Turing machine" or "bombe". Whenever the
              German Enigma altered its encryption combinations, the bombe quickly
              computed potential keys, enabling swift decryption(Hodges 2014).

                In 1950, Turing published a famous paper in the Mind journal
                titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". The opening line
                posed a question, a question that many computer scientists and
                philosophers continue to ponder. Instead of providing an answer,
                Turing presented a method to determine the correctness of any
                answer-called "The Imitation Game"(Turing 2012). This method,
                later termed the Turing Test, profoundly impacted the philosophy
                and ethics of AI.

                Additionally, Turing laid foundational concepts for the early
                computer ACE (Automatic Computing Engine). Although this computer
                was not built exactly according to his full design, his ideas
                influenced subsequent computer designs(Copeland 2005).

              Turing's personal life was marked by tragedy in his later years.
              Homosexuality was illegal in the UK at the time, and Turing was
              found guilty and chose chemical castration as his punishment. On
              June 7, 1954, Turing died of cyanide poisoning, believed to be
              suicide.

              After Turing's death, his contributions to computer science, his
              country, and the world were gradually recognized and acclaimed. In
              1966, the Turing Award was established in his honor, representing
              the academic community's utmost respect. In 2009, UK Prime
              Minister Gordon Brown formally apologized to Turing on behalf of the
              government, for the judgement. On Christmas Eve in 2013, Queen Elizabeth II
              announced a posthumous pardon for Turing, and in 2017, the Alan
              Turing Law came into effect. A monument in a Manchester park
              reads: "Alan Mathison Turing, Father of Computer Science,
              Mathematician, Logician. Wartime Codebreaker, Victim of
              Prejudice".
