              Jeanette Wing introduced the concept of Computational Thinking in 2006, asserting that it is a skill—a fundamental ability that everyone can acquire. Through methods such as decomposition, abstraction, categorization, and reorganization, people can tackle complex projects (Wing 2006). It's not just in the realm of computing; problems across various disciplines like mathematics, engineering, and management can be solved through Computational Thinking.

                By breaking down, reorganizing, and planning tasks,
                Computational Thinking provides us the courage to challenge
                seemingly intricate projects.

                After continuously engaging in Computational Thinking for a long
                time, we can quickly discern the essence and connections behind
                problems, thereby enhancing our logical thinking abilities.

                In a large-scale project, once tasks are broken down and
                reorganized, they can be more clearly assigned to each team
                member, saving time and boosting team efficiency.
              </li>

                When objectives are vague, there's a risk of becoming too
                engrossed in the details and wasting substantial time. However,
                with clear tasks and timelines for everyone, the chances of this
                happening are greatly reduced.

                Whether in our current or future careers, regardless of the
                field, we can execute tasks more effectively with Computational
                Thinking. For instance, in the construction industry where I
                previously worked, tasks can be divided into four segments:
                background research, data organization, conceptual proposal, and
                proposal enhancement (floor plan design, three-dimensional
                modeling). Each task can further be segmented into smaller
                sub-tasks, making the entire design project coherent and
                structured.

            The CMT119 Computational Thinking Module is the introductory course in our MSc computing programme. Through meticulous explanations, the instructors demonstrate how to convert real-world problems into logical chains, abstract them into computer languages, and eventually solve them using computers. This gives students from varied backgrounds a preliminary insight into the computer industry and a general orientation for our future careers. 
            When applying for this programme, I had some ideas about the digitization of the architecture industry. I believe that upon completing this programme, I will have the opportunity to realize them.
