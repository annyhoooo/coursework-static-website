        <h3>REFLECTION on learning</h3>
        <p>
          "CMT119 Computational Thinking Module" as the first course of Msc
          Computing, paints a picture of what the world of computer science
          looks like and how it operates. It encourages us to use Computational
          thinking to solve real-world problems.

            <h5>Understanding Computational Thinking</h5>
            <p>
              Before the course, I was completely unfamiliar with the concept of
              "Computational Thinking". As the course progressed, I gradually
              realised its pervasive presence and importance in our daily life.
              Computational thinking is not just for programming or computer
              science. It is a way of thinking about problem-solving, helping us
              to analyse, evaluate, and find solutions. Through decomposition,
              abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithms, I have learned
              how to solve problems more systematically and effectively.

            <h5>Basic Programming</h5>
            <p>
              Through this module, I learned basic concepts in programming, such
              as the use of variables, the characteristics of different
              datatypes and how to choose the appropriate datatype, the
              application of conditions and loops, and the writing and calling
              of functions. I marveled at human ingenuity in breaking down
              complex real-world problems into abstract thoughts, writing
              processes, and algorithms for computers to handle.

            <h5>Learning to Use Software Development Tools</h5>
            <p>
              Before starting the program, I had always been a computer software
              user. After entering this module, I learned about the tools that
              we, as developers, need to use. For instance, how to use the
              command line in the terminal for interfaces. I discovered that I
              could use software like Atom and Visual Studio Code as text
              editors for programming. They support multiple programming
              languages and are user-friendly for editing.

            <h5>Making Static Web Pages</h5>
            <p>
              Previously, I only designed web pages using Photoshop and
              PowerPoint. But in this module, I learned how to use HTML and CSS
              to create web pages. HTML is used to structure the content, while
              CSS styles and formats it. JavaScript allows interaction with the
              webpage. I used to think the design part was too subjective and
              lacked logic. But after this module, I found web page creation to
              be very logical. I had to plan the webpage's structure and
              framework first, and then use HTML and CSS to implement it.

              "Let's get rid of the details!" This is a phrase often repeated by
              Nico and Daniela in class, helping us avoid getting bogged down in
              minutiae. In this module, I learned for the first time how to
              properly use references. The instructors introduced many learning
              resources, such as Google and MDN.

            <h5>For Programming Languages</h5>
            <p>
              Learning the basics of programming has laid a solid foundation for
              my future study of other programming languages. Core concepts like
              variables, loops, and functions are prevalent in almost all
              programming languages. Many languages differ mainly in syntax, not
              in basic concepts. Therefore, mastering the basic concepts in one
              language can help you learn another faster, saving much
              re-learning effort.

              CMT 119 has taught me a very practical way of learning and
              problem-solving. I am gradually accustomed to facing daily
              problems with Computational Thinking, breaking complex issues into
              manageable parts using decomposition and reconstruction.

            <p>
              In this coursework, I employed the approach of Computational
              Thinking. First, I broke it down into smaller problems, then
              further decomposed those problems into even smaller issues. After
              pondering, I wrote down the answers and finally organized them
              into a mind map. This mind map also served as the blueprint for
              constructing the framework and content of my website. Based on it,
              I proceeded to design the layout of the pages in PowerPoint, and
              finally realized my ideas using HTML and CSS. This process allowed
              me to appreciate the charm of Computational Thinking and logical
              reasoning.

          The "Computational Thinking" course has opened a new door for me. It
          has not only enriched my knowledge base but also honed my thinking and
          problem-solving skills. I realize this is just the beginning. More
          challenges await in the future, but I am ready to embrace them.
